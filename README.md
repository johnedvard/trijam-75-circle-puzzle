# Game Jam Seed

This is a project used as a seed to start creating your game without doing all the heavy lifting by setting up your project

This project uses typescript and Kontra as the game engine.

## Start testing your game

Run the following in your terminal window

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Test online using Netlify

The simplest way to share your game with friends is to create an account on Netlify.
Then drag and drop the dist folder into your new site.

### Continuous integration

Tired of dragging and dropping the build to netlify?
Set up a hook to your github repo, and start building when you push to your desired branch.

-- TODO create instructions on how to deploy to Netlify
